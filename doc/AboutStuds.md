# About Studs

TODO: actually describe this doo-hickey :)

Studs grew out of work on a commercial [Fantom][fantom]-based embedded system.
One of the key take aways from that project was a large percentage of the
effort involved in getting Fantom operating on, and interacting with, embedded
hardware was largely general purpose (and boiler-plate).

With the increasing availability of low-cost embedded platforms, such as the
Raspberry Pi and Beaglebone, there is a huge opportunity to bring embedded
development to a much larger community, both as a hobby and commercially. Studs
is an attempt to fill part of that void for developers who's background or
preference favors languages simliar to [Fantom][fantom].

Early in the original design of Studs, the [Nerves Project][nerves] began to
gain popularity. Nerves bears an uncanny similarity to what Studs was
attempting to achieve -- as well as including a number of very useful design
decisions that had not been considered. The present Studs project is largely
based on the phenomenal work of the [Nerves team][nerves_team].
